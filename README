Description:
* This program is a classic raiden game that runs by pygame. Raiden is a scrolling shooter 
game. In our game, the player will control a hero jet to battle the enemies and survive in
the battle. The player will use directions keys to control the jet and space bar to shoot
the bullet. 

* As you run the game, you can see a start menu that says press ENTER to log in or press ESC 
to quit. And there are also the instructions of how to play at the bottom.

* As you press ENTER to start the game, you should type your name and press ENTER to confirm.

* Then you can see a rank list that shows top players in your friend zone and the best score 
you got. If it is the first time that you use this name to play our game, only your own name 
will be shown on the rank list. Then, you can press space bar to add new friend. We use Graph 
and BSF to achieve this.We use breadth first search to search all of friends and friends' friends to be related to you. 

* After adding a friend, you can see your friend on the rank list if his score is in the top 
9 among all of your friends. Moreover, it will automatically add your friend's friends on the 
rank list too. 

* Then you can press ENTER to start the game. You have totally three lives. There are totally 
two different types of enemies planes. They will spawn randomly and shoot automatically.

* If you get any scores that are divisible by 500, the boss will be spawned. At the beginning, 
the boss will only shoot one type of bullets which can be formed a circle with increasing 
radius. If the health of boss is below 100, the boss will shoot missiles. Those missiles will 
chase the position of the hero plane all the time, but the bullets of hero plane can destroy 
those missiles. We use mahanttan distance and trigonometry to implement the algorithm of 
missiles. 

* After you run out of three lives, it will display the ending menu. After you quit the game, 
the best score you get and the relationship with your friends will be written in two text file
which are userData.txt and userRelations.txt respectively. We will build the new graph during
the next start of the game. The graph we build is an undirected graph.

UPDATE SINCE DEMO:
* Rewrite classes for planes used inhertance to reduce hard coding
* Implemented different game difficulty when user gets higher score
* Updated missiles tracing path algorithms for more smoth curve path movement
* Updated garbage collection mechnism. Set boundaries for both enemies planes and all bullets,
  and check boundries every fame. When bullets or enemies planes objects are out of boudaries,
  delete and disable objects.

WARNING:
* Make sure python 3.5 and above version is installed
* Make sure correct version of pygame for python 3.5 or above is installed
* The game will only run once, to start new game, the old game window must be closed
